# Python Practice

A collection of Python exercises and small scripts, organized alphabetically by topic.

Current folders:
- basics
- classes
- conditionals
- functions
- lists-and-dicts
- loops
- mini-projects
- misc
- variables

Each file includes the prompt and date for reference.  
This repo tracks my progress as I build stronger fundamentals in Python.
